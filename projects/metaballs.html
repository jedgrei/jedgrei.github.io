        This started out as a background for an Onirim recreation, but it turns out that it was deep enough to warrant its own project.
        At first I tried drawing each circle to the screen and then connecting them with bezier curves (semi-following <a href="https://varun.ca/metaballs/">this</a>), but it turns out that that's a) inneficient,
        and b) really messy. Switching over to just sampling the metaballs and using marching squares to smooth them out made it look significantly better.
        Plus, it let me set multiple thresholds to make a gradient-like effect. I started off with <a href="https://jamie-wong.com/2014/08/19/metaballs-and-marching-squares/">this</a> tutorial,
        but I had to modify it a bit to fill in the image.

        The fun part was making it modular enough to try out different looks and color palettes. I was hoping to make this open-ended, but with it as-is, there's too many knobs to tweak.
        For now though, I tried to make some fun presets. You can check them out by clicking their respective images.
