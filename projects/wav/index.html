        <b>Shenzhen Solitaire</b> is a solitaire variant created for the game Shenzhen I/O, by Zachtronics.
        I prefer it to Klondike solitiare (the "normal" version), mainly due to the larger number of
        winnable deals (<b>99%!</b>). It also just feels like it has more sustenance, instead of being driven
        only by randomness. So, I thought it would be worth trying to create it from scratch.
        <br><br>
        I made my version using SDL2 and C++, with Adobe Illustrator for the graphics. I think it turned out well
        (although I do have to clean it up a little bit). If you enjoyed it, you should check out 
        <a href="https://www.zachtronics.com/shenzhen-io/">the original</a> and support

        <h1>Instructions</h1>
        Shenzhen Solitaire is fairly similar to FreeCell. Cards can be stacked descending (with alternating colors), and single cards can be put into the 3 cells at the top-right.
        Numbered cards can be placed from 1-9, by suit, in the foundations at the top-left.
        However, there are now 3 suits, all with seperate colors, and 4 <b>dragons</b>, which cannot be stacked on other cards. There's also a <b>flower card</b>, which clears itself.
        All 4 dragons of the same color can be removed into a cell by pressing their respective button when they are all uncovered.
        They need either a open cell, or a cell with one of the dragons in it. Once the dragons occupy a cell, no other cards can be placed into it.
        <br><br>
        If the foundations are full and the dragons have all been cleared, you win!
